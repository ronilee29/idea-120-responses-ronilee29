In this article, Salter writes about Wagner and his Gesamtkunstwerk where he presented his grand performance with various uses of special effects, architecture, and an all encompassing environmental experience for the viewers. In the modern era I have seen examples of this in various modern art exhibits with large scale projections, soundscapes, and light shows. I enjoyed the Barbara Kruger exhibit at the Art Institute which features all of these things and more.

I think an example that can be found on the Rhizome anthology is the 386 DX. This cyber punk band features digital instruments and lyric reading. This experience is an audio visual presentation of popular music in a busking setting on the city streets. The viewers are immersed in an everyday environment which is juxtaposed against the aged and boxy digital computer.
