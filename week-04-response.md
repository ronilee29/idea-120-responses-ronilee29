This Click bait image showing a woman with a picture of an ear and a hearing aid looking device could be seen much differently in another medium.
If this was seen on instagram or tumblr it could be seen as a very aesthetic image or a commentary on plastic surgery etc.
The linguistic message here or caption "The invisible hearing aid" is purely marketing and draws you to consider what you cannot see in the image. It also tells you that the product is a hearing aid. It also tells us the product is small and powerful.
The Coded iconic message: The coded message is that this hearing aid goes in your ear and is meant to be nearly invisible even when you zoom into the ear.
The non-coded iconic message: This beautiful person is wearing a nearly hidden device so for you to be beautiful you must hide your electronic device away too.
