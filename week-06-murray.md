 I think Murray's predictions were very spot on especially when speaking about how viewing is shifting to a more interactive space. As we begin to embracce live streams, live concerts, and VR entertainment there is no doubt that the needs are different. 
 My favorrite fan moment was when someone showed me that someone had made a Steven Universe world in Minecraft that you could explore and play in. 
 I think when we think about the mandalorian it feels like the beginning of some incredible emerging technologies that uses tracking, image mapping, and 3D environmental rendering.
 It starts the conversation about putting first the actors and then the viewers in these environments and I think could lead to VR watchign at home in some incredible ways. This could also change how many performances and concerts are viewed and interacted with.
 These are really exciting things to think about as technologies begin to combine and advance.
