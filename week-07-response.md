I was very alarmed to learn more about these AI generated kids content that is more about generating revenue than protecting or educating these vulnerable children. 
I agree with Bridle on many points here specifically that it is Youtube and Google's responsibility to help filter these bots out or put protocols in place that can help parents protect kids.
They are perpetuating harm here and it will have rippling psychological effects for this generation that we are just begining to uncover now. 

As a person who alos grew up with too much free accesss to the internet, it scares me too and I have major concerns about the safety of people all over the world be especially children who have no idea
the implications and are not being taught them because their own guardians dont understand. I think internet safety is a public educational need and should be encorporated into these systems by their own designers.
They have a responsibility to their users to inform and protect them and not prioritize capitalistic money making over that.
